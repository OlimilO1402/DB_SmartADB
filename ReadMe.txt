This small Visual Basic project for the intermediate developer shows a complete database program without ever using any database driver. 
Just like a typical Windows desktop application it saves files to harddisk with its own file-extension and stores files in the well known 
format of IFC (Industry foundation classes) aka STEP-format aka ISO-10303. This format is capable of serializing any class hierarchy.
This VB-project also shows how to implement Cut+Copy+Paste and Undo+Redo functionality. It has it's own file-icon.
